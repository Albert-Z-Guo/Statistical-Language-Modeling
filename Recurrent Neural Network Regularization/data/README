# Data description:

## Penn Treebank Corpora
  - the same processing of data as used in many LM papers, including [Empirical Evaluation and Combination of Advanced Language Modeling Techniques](https://www.isca-speech.org/archive/archive_papers/interspeech_2011/i11_0605.pdf)
  - `ptb.train.txt`: train set
  - `ptb.valid.txt`: development set (should be used just for tuning hyper-parameters, but not for training)
  - `ptb.test.txt`: test set for reporting perplexity
  - `ptb.char.*`: the same data, just rewritten as sequences of characters, with spaces rewritten as `_` - useful for training character based models, as is shown in example 9

## Wikitext-2 Corpora
  - `wiki.train.txt`: train set
  - `wiki.valid.txt`: development set (should be used just for tuning hyper-parameters, but not for training)
  - `wiki.test.txt`: test set for reporting perplexity
